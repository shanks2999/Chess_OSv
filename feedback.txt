Hi Shashank:
this is a nicely done homework - well-structured with the video and tests. I would like to see more in your documentation describing your negative experiences and what situations your less than optimal choices led you to.

Unfortunately, there is no docker deployment.

Regardless, you earned 5%. Well done, congratulations!


Thank you,
Mark
